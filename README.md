# GetRemoteOffers - ASAP
I created this guide out of my passion for the developer community. A star üåü on this repo would be greatly appreciated ü§ó, as it motivates me to dedicate more time to it.

If you have any comments, ideas, or appreciation, please use the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) tab. Don't hesitate to **clone**, **fork**, and submit **pull requests**!

This guide is designed like a to-do list, so there's no need to read it all at once. In each step, I purposefully suggest only one tool to keep you from wondering what to use. Just follow each step, slaying one dragon at a time, until you land that job offer.

## Resume Prepration
I was a fan of creating my resume using my own LaTeX template, but I realized that although my resume looked professional and polished, it wasn't easily readable by machines‚Äîthe very machines we humans created!

Before your resume reaches a real human, it‚Äôs often first skimmed by an Application Tracking System (ATS). Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your resume's text is readable and extractable by these systems. While I love the authenticity of a handcrafted resume, it's in your best interest to use resume builders to create your resume. Most ATS are optimized for these resume formats and can read them easily. This increases your chances of being noticed and, hopefully, invited to an interview.

[Resume.com](https://www.resume.com/) is a great, free, easy to use tool to create resume.

Notes:
- Don‚Äôt rely on ChatGPT to write your entire resume. Instead, draft it yourself and use ChatGPT as a helper. A simple prompt like, ‚ÄúRewrite and keep my tone,‚Äù can refine your text while preserving authenticity, eliminating grammar or dictation errors, and often enhancing the wording.
- **Check for grammar and spelling mistakes** using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/). Writing correctly is crucial as it reflects your attention to detail.
- **Ensure all links work** properly across different environments.
- **Include the location for each job.** If you have remote work experience, label it as ‚Äúremote.‚Äù This is a positive signal for remote-first companies, showing you‚Äôre experienced in remote team collaboration.
- **Upload your resume to [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com/)** and aim for a score of 80 or higher. The tool provides valuable feedback to improve your resume, and you can also explore their public resources for additional tips. Iterate until you‚Äôre satisfied before moving on.



## Customized Cover Letter Generation
A resume is a finely-tuned document that takes a lot of effort to perfect. This makes it challenging to customize every single time (though if you can, that's fantastic). That's where a cover letter comes in‚Äîit's your chance to build on your resume and explain why you're the ideal candidate for this specific job.

Keep your cover letter simple, concise, and straight to the point. Put yourself in the recruiter's shoes: Why should they choose you? Make yourself stand out. How? Start by carefully reading the job posting and researching the company. In your cover letter, be genuine‚Äîshare which aspects of their business resonate with you and highlight the skills and expertise you bring to the table that align with the job.

I've noticed some people skip the cover letter entirely, and that's a big mistake. Leaving it blank sends the message that you're not really serious about the opportunity.

I've developed a tool that makes creating customized cover letters and tracking job applications easier‚Äîall in one place: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLJsuzzWHczKW7iCFxVbFBNklphQIl29-j2WxLb1geQ/edit?usp=sharing

## Start Applying for Jobs
As you may know the main source for the job opportunities is Linkedin. Start applying on Linkedin. These are the tips:
- Complete your profile. You can use Linkedin Premium to get AI assisted headlines, text, and more insight on the job market.
- Ask from previous co-workers to write a recommendation for you.
- Put a smily, not overly formal picture of yourself as the profile picture. Don't put a full-lenght photo, just your face and make it visible.
- Try to engage and publish contents related to your field.
- Make yourself stand out. Pass the Linkedin assesments to be promoted by Linkedin to recruiters: 
- Never apply using EasyApply. Most of the times Linkedin is not connected to the ATS softwares and it's hard for recruiters to check your resume. Instead, go and apply on their website directly.

As you may know, LinkedIn is the main source for job opportunities, so start applying there. Here are some tips:

- **Complete your profile.** Consider using LinkedIn Premium for AI-assisted headlines, personalized text, and deeper insights into the job market.
- **Request recommendations** from former co-workers to strengthen your profile.
- **Use a friendly, not overly formal profile picture.** A close-up of your face is ideal‚Äîskip the full-length shot‚Äîand make sure it‚Äôs visible to others.
- **Engage with content** related to your field and publish your own to increase your visibility.
- **Stand out by passing LinkedIn assessments.** This can help LinkedIn promote you to recruiters. ![LinkedInAssessment](./Images/LinkedInAssessment.png)
- **Avoid using EasyApply.** Often, LinkedIn isn‚Äôt fully integrated with ATS software, making it harder for recruiters to see your resume. Instead, apply directly on the company's website.
- **Search for worldwide opportunities.** Include "worldwide" in your search ŸÖÿÆÿ≤ÿ¥ŸÅŸáÿÆÿØ for remote jobs to expand your options and see more opportunities. ![WorldWide](./Images/WorldWide.png)
- **Prioritize job posts with under 10 applicants.** With less competition, you have a better chance of landing an interview. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean you should ignore other job postings‚Äîapply broadly, but focus on those with fewer applicants first. ![Under10](./Images/Under10.png) 
- **Obviously, turn on the remote option** in your job search filters.
