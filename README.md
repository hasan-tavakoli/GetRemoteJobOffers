# GetRemoteOffers - ASAP
I created this guide out of my passion for the developer community. A star üåü on this repo would be greatly appreciated ü§ó, as it motivates me to dedicate more time to it.

If you have any comments, ideas, or appreciation, please use the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) tab. Don't hesitate to **clone**, **fork**, and submit **pull requests**!

This guide is designed like a to-do list, so there's no need to read it all at once. In each step, I purposefully suggest only one tool to keep you from wondering what to use. Just follow each step, slaying one dragon at a time, until you land that job offer.

## Resume Prepration
I was a fan of creating my resume using my own LaTeX template, but I realized that although my resume looked professional and polished, it wasn't easily readable by machines‚Äîthe very machines we humans created!

Before your resume reaches a real human, it‚Äôs often first skimmed by an Application Tracking System (ATS). Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your resume's text is readable and extractable by these systems. While I love the authenticity of a handcrafted resume, it's in your best interest to use resume builders to create your resume. Most ATS are optimized for these resume formats and can read them easily. This increases your chances of being noticed and, hopefully, invited to an interview.

[Resume.com](https://www.resume.com/) is a great, free, easy to use tool to create resume.

Notes:
- Don‚Äôt rely on ChatGPT to write your entire resume. Instead, draft it yourself and use ChatGPT as a helper. A simple prompt like, ‚ÄúRewrite and keep my tone,‚Äù can refine your text while preserving authenticity, eliminating grammar or dictation errors, and often enhancing the wording.
- **Check for grammar and spelling mistakes** using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/). Writing correctly is crucial as it reflects your attention to detail.
- **Ensure all links work** properly across different environments.
- **Include the location for each job.** If you have remote work experience, label it as ‚Äúremote.‚Äù This is a positive signal for remote-first companies, showing you‚Äôre experienced in remote team collaboration.
- **Upload your resume to [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com/)** and aim for a score of 80 or higher. The tool provides valuable feedback to improve your resume, and you can also explore their public resources for additional tips. Iterate until you‚Äôre satisfied before moving on.



## Customized Cover Letter Generation
A resume is a finely-tuned document that takes a lot of effort to perfect. This makes it challenging to customize every single time (though if you can, that's fantastic). That's where a cover letter comes in‚Äîit's your chance to build on your resume and explain why you're the ideal candidate for this specific job.

Keep your cover letter simple, concise, and straight to the point. Put yourself in the recruiter's shoes: Why should they choose you? Make yourself stand out. How? Start by carefully reading the job posting and researching the company. In your cover letter, be genuine‚Äîshare which aspects of their business resonate with you and highlight the skills and expertise you bring to the table that align with the job.

I've noticed some people skip the cover letter entirely, and that's a big mistake. Leaving it blank sends the message that you're not really serious about the opportunity.

I've developed a tool that makes creating customized cover letters and tracking job applications easier‚Äîall in one place: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLJsuzzWHczKW7iCFxVbFBNklphQIl29-j2WxLb1geQ/edit?usp=sharing

## Start Applying for Jobs

### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
As you may know, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) is the main source for job opportunities, so start applying there. Here are some tips:

- **Complete your profile.** Consider using LinkedIn Premium for AI-assisted headlines, personalized text, and deeper insights into the job market.
- **Request recommendations** from former co-workers to strengthen your profile.
- **Use a friendly, not overly formal profile picture.** A close-up of your face is ideal‚Äîskip the full-length shot‚Äîand make sure it‚Äôs visible to others.
- **Engage with content** related to your field and publish your own to increase your visibility.
- **Pass LinkedIn assessments.** This can help LinkedIn promote you to recruiters. ![LinkedInAssessment](./Images/LinkedInAssessment.png)
- **Avoid using EasyApply.** Often, LinkedIn isn‚Äôt fully integrated with ATS software, making it harder for recruiters to see your resume. Instead, apply directly on the company's website.
- **Search for worldwide opportunities.** Include "worldwide" in your search location for remote jobs to expand your options and see more opportunities. ![WorldWide](./Images/WorldWide.png)
- **Prioritize job posts with under 10 applicants.** With less competition, you have a better chance of landing an interview. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean you should ignore other job postings‚Äîapply broadly, but focus on those with fewer applicants first. ![Under10](./Images/Under10.png) 
- **Obviously, turn on the remote option** in your job search filters.

Absolutely, LinkedIn is a powerhouse for job hunting, but don't sleep on other platforms. They often have less competition, giving you a better shot at landing something great. Case in point: I found my London gig on [Cord.co](https://cord.co/).

### [Cord](https://cord.co/)
[Cord](https://cord.co/) is more UK-centric with a smaller pool of listings. You can set up an account, but don't be surprised if your resume gets rejected and you're unable to message recruiters directly on the platform. No big deal though‚Äîjust head to the company's website and apply directly!

### [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/)
If you're after remote work, [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/) is a gem.

### [HoneyPot](https://www.honeypot.io/)

[HoneyPot](https://www.honeypot.io/) is a reverse-apply platform, meaning you set up your profile, and companies come to you with job opportunities. The great part is that once your profile is ready, you don't have to do much else. We also leverage HoneyPot for its resources. One standout feature is the dedicated talent advisor who can set up mock interviews for you at no cost, so you can practice before the real thing‚Äîdefinitely a game-changer.

They also have a [dev-community](https://cult.honeypot.io/) packed with in-depth reports, offering valuable insights into the job market if that‚Äôs something you're interested in.

One thing to note: when creating your account, you'll be asked about the types of jobs you're after. If you say you're only looking for remote roles, your account might not get activated. A better strategy is to indicate that you're open to jobs and willing to relocate, but with a preference for remote work. This is actually realistic because if an amazing relocation offer comes your way, you might just take it.

### [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm)
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm) is primarily known for its company reviews, giving you insight into what it's like to work at different places. But don't overlook their job section‚Äîit's a solid resource where you can search for and apply to jobs as well.


### [Indeed](https://indeed.com/)
[Indeed](https://indeed.com/) is one of the largest job listing platforms out there, offering a vast range of opportunities across different industries.

### [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
[WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) is also another source for remote jobs.

### [Wellfound (Formerly AngelList)](https://wellfound.com/)
[Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/) focuses on startup job opportunities, especially in North America. However, keep in mind that if you have more than a 2-hour time zone difference, your chances of landing an interview might decrease.

### [GolangProjects](https://www.golangprojects.com/)
[GolangProjects](https://www.golangprojects.com/) is dedicated to Go developers, making it a solid resource for Go-related job opportunities.

I'm always on the lookout for more domain and language-specific job platforms, so if you know of any, feel free to share them in the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) section.
