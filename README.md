I created this guide out of my passion for the developer community. A star ðŸŒŸ on this repo would be greatly appreciated ðŸ¤—, as it motivates me to dedicate more time to it.

If you have any comments, ideas, or appreciation, please use the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) tab. Don't hesitate to **clone**, **fork**, and submit **pull requests**!

This guide is designed like a to-do list, so there's no need to read it all at once. In each step, I purposefully suggest only one tool to keep you from wondering what to use. Just follow each step, slaying one dragon at a time, until you land that job offer.

## Resume Prepration
I was a fan of creating my resume using my own LaTeX template, but I realized that although my resume looked professional and polished, it wasn't easily readable by machinesâ€”the very machines we humans created!

Before your resume reaches a real human, itâ€™s often first skimmed by an Application Tracking System (ATS). Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your resume's text is readable and extractable by these systems. While I love the authenticity of a handcrafted resume, it's in your best interest to use resume builders to create your resume. Most ATS are optimized for these resume formats and can read them easily. This increases your chances of being noticed and, hopefully, invited to an interview.

[Resume.com](https://www.resume.com/) is a great, free, easy to use tool to create resume.

Notes:
- Don't use ChatGPT to write the whole resume for you. Instead, write it yourself and use ChatGPT as an assistant. A simple command is: "Rewrite and keep my tone." This approach keeps your text authentic, but without grammar or dictation mistakes, and sometimes with better wording.
- Check for dictation and grammar mistakes using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/). It is very important to write correctly, as it shows your attention to detail.
- Make sure all the links are working properly in different environments.
- Include the location for each job, and if you have remote work experience, indicate "remote". This is a good sign for remote-first companies, showing that you have experience working in remote teams.
- Upload your resume to the [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com/) and get your score. Aim for 80 or more. The tool itself gives you a helpful feedback how to make your resume better. You can also read their public material to learn how to write a better resume. Re-iterate on this until you're satisfied then go to the next step.
